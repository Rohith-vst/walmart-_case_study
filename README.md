Business Problem:


The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the 
ustomerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits
differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female)




Insights:
1)There are no null values in the data.

2)Outliers are found in Purchase category but we have no need to remove them as they are needed for evaluation.

3)From the Male and female sample means we found using CLT with 95% confidence we can say that the intervals of mean Purchase intervals of both male and female are overlapping.

4)The purchase of both married and unmarried customers are overlapping.

5)The purchase of all the age groups are also overlapping.

6)There is also no correlation found between any of the categories in the data.

7)The means of male and female doesn't seems to vary much so we cannot treat Male and female differently during the sale.

8)The average purchases of different categories in the Marital status and the different age group of the customers doesn't affect the purchases so we can't consider them differently as there is no bias.

9)There seems to be no sampling bias in the data and we use this data as it is for analysis.

Recommendations:
1)Walmart has a majority of male customers. Also on an average Walmart's male customers spend more than its female customers. Keeping customer acquisition in mind Walmart can provide some extra discounts on women's day to attract female population

2)Maximum of Walmart's customers are in age group of 26-35 and least number of customers in age group of 0-17 and 55+. On the other hand, customers in age group of 51-55 make more purchase. Hence giving student discounts and senior citizens discounts can attract customers from age group of 0-17 and 55+

3)Has majority of its customers from city category B. Providing discounts to customers in city A and C or advertising more in these cities can help in attracting customers from these cities.

4)Product categories 7, 9, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 20 are least purchased products. Advertising these products more can help increase demand for these products

5)8,9, 13, 18 occupation level customers are least in Walmart. Targeting these level customers by advertising more to them can help acquire more customers from these levels.
